This repo use Git Large File Storage (LFS) that replaces large files with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com.

Currently, the associated files are:

- psd
- ai
- sketch

If you add a new file format, you need to associate it with a large file in this repository. You need Git LFS, if you don't have it, [follow this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/installing-git-large-file-storage).
To associate a file type in your repository with Git LFS, enter git lfs track followed by the name of the file extension you want to automatically upload to Git LFS.

For example, to associate a .psd file, enter the following command:

```
$ git lfs track "*.psd"
> Adding path *.psd
```

Every file type you want to associate with Git LFS will need to be added with git lfs track. This command amends your repository's `.gitattributes` file and associates large files with Git LFS.
